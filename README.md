# Lovense

Short test program in C++ for Lovense.
The test program searches and connects with the nearest toy.
Then the program sends out commands to vibrate the toy.
In this example it vibrates on the levels 1, 2 and 3.
For each vibration level the toy vibrates for 2 seconds.
At the end it will disconnect the toy.

In the attachment you will find:

1. The folder "source_code" contains the C++ code
In that archive you will find a visual studio project together with the C++ files.
If you want to compile the visual studio project on your PC, then you need to set the configuration to "Release".
You can use Visual Studio Community.

2. The folder "executable_win_10_64_bit" contains the compiled executable for Windows 10 (64 bit)
LovenseTest.exe and LovenseToys.dll need to be in the same folder.
